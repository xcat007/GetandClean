Getting and Cleaning data Coursera

The analysis.R file:

takes the test and train data, appends them together, includes the subject IDs for both data sets, includes the Activity Name for 
each activity.

It then selects all of the columns of mean and standard deviation data and calulates the average of each for each 
combination of subject and activity.

Sorry for the lack of additional explanation, thought project was due at 11:30 pacific instead of 11:30 UTC...
